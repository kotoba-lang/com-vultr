  "Portable core for talking to the Vultr API v2 -- one auth/HTTP boundary
  for every vultr.* namespace in this library.

  Query construction and response parsing are pure .cljc. The actual HTTP
  call is JVM-only by default (java.net.http) but always takes an
  injectable `:http-fn` -- the same `{:url :method :headers :body} ->
  {:status :body}` convention as gmail.client/cloudflare.client/wise.client
  (kotoba-lang/com-gmail, kotoba-lang/com-cloudflare, kotoba-lang/com-wise)
  -- so every namespace here is testable with a stub, never only against a
  live account.

  Auth is a bearer API key (Account -> API in the Vultr customer portal).
  Obtaining that key is out of scope for this library -- callers pass one,
  the same way cloudflare.client expects a pre-obtained
  CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN. Vultr has no public sandbox API, unlike Wise, so
  there is only one `api-base`."
